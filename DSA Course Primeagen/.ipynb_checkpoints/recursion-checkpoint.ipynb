    "- Simplest way to think of recursion is a function that calls itself until the problem is solved. This usually involves a \"base case\" that is the point at which the problem is solved.\n",
    "- **Always clearly identify your base case** (the most important part). If you don't have a good base case, Recursion is excelptionally hard. If you can identify a good/clever base case, Recursion is easy.\n",

    "### Three Important values of a function \n",
    "- Return Address: each time a function is called, it needs to know how it got where it is, and where to hand back it's value.\n",
    "- Return Value: What is the function returning?\n",
    "- Arguments: What is being passed into the function?\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example - General Overview \n",
    "- This function will execute, where the return address will be pointing to the function that called it, in this case it will be the function itself. Under the hood, we are essentially creating a stack trace. If this function were to error out before hitting the base case and completing, it would show a stack trace of the succession of function calls. \n",
    "- The return values will essentially be incomplete until we hit our base case because half of calculating the return value is dependent on a function that hasn't completed yet. We are waiting for it to complete.\n",
    "- Arguments are just the same as those being passed in.\n",
    "- In terms of execution, we essentially go down the stack until we hit our base case, then go back up the stack, ending on the original calling method.\n"
