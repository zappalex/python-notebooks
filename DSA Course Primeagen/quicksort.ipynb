    "# Quick Sort \n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a \"divider and conquer\" algorithm -> Split your input into smaller chunks, go over those smaller sub sections themselves, keep splitting until it's something easy to solve.\n",
    "- There is also **Merge Sort**, that is not covered here, but also very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm \n",
    "- We pick a pointer in the array, \"P\" that is our pivot. Ideally, this is near the middle of the array \n",
    "- We have another pointer at the start of the array, that walks the array to the point P and all values greater than P are placed after it, all items less than P before it.\n",
    "- This is referred to as a **weak sort**\n",
    "- From here we split the sorting area into two groups, before and after the pivot, and we do the same thing all over agin.\n",
    "- once we get to the point where each array is 0 or 1, we can stop. It is sorted.\n",
    "- **Note:** low and high values in the partition are both inclusive. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Time\n",
    "- Best Case: O(NlogN) with good pivots\n",
    "- Worst Case: O(N^2) in the case of a reverse sorted array and bad pivots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategies: \n",
    "- Always pick pivot in the middle of the range, not random\n",
    "- Chances of hitting all the wrong conditions that lead to N^2 is pretty low anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes: \n",
    "- Merge Sort will always do O(NlogN) but the constant in front of it can be rather large, thus it will not always perform better than Quick Sort. "
