    "- An important question you should ALWAYS ask of your data set: Is it ordered?\n",
    "- If it is, you have new advantages you can take with that data.\n",
    "- One approach we can take is to step a certain amount to see if we're in the range of the intended value, say 10% of the data set and then search the full section it's in.\n",
    "- This will result in O(N) but illustrates the philosophy of this method. Practically, it will be better than Linear Search. Theoretically, it will be the same. What we primarily want to avoid here is the scanning. \n",

    "### Algorithm \n",
    "- We can instead jump to the middle, see if the search value is larger or smaller than the found value.\n",
    "- If smaller, we do the same thing for the smaller half of the data set, and vice versa for larger.\n",
    "- We continue to half the data set and compare until we have nothing left to search.\n",
    "- This will give us a runtime of O(logN)\n",
    "- Big O trick: if you are halving each time: O(logN), if you are halving each time and then scanning at some point: O(NlogN)\n",

    "- This gives us three options:\n",
    "1. We find the value: return value \n",
    "2. Value is larger: lo = m + 1\n",
    "3. Value is smaller: hi = m\n",
